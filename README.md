1. VR ART GALLERY-
Overview~
A VR Art Gallery is a fully virtual interactive environment through which the user navigates to visit and view the artwork in a computer-simulated 3D environment. Within the gallery, users can navigate via VR controllers so they are free to walk, touch,       manipulate objects in the scene, and touch or observe artwork closely. 

Features~
-Controller-Based Movement & Interaction
Consumers navigate the gallery using handheld VR controllers to walk around, teleport from one room to another, zoom in on paintings, spin sculptures, or grab information cards on the artists and pieces.
-Voice Interaction-
Voice commands offer a hands-free experience. Consumers can give voice commands such as "Show artist info," "Next room," "Play audio guide," or "Zoom in," and users feel more natural and included.
-Immersive Experience-
The gallery can reproduce lighting, ambient noise, and realistic room acoustics to maximize immersion, making users feel as if they are within an actual art museum. Such a VR gallery unites visual design with interactive technology to provide an immersive way of experiencing art â€” perfect for education, entertainment, and digital exhibitions.
